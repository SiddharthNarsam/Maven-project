ABSTRACT
STIVAN (Startup Idea Validator and Analyzer) is an AI-powered, full-stack web application designed to 
assist aspiring entrepreneurs in evaluating the feasibility, potential impact, and market readiness of 
their startup ideas. The system integrates advanced natural language processing and retrieval￾augmented generation techniques to analyze user-submitted ideas and provide intelligent, data￾driven insights. Users interact with a modern React.js frontend, where they can submit ideas and 
receive feedback generated by a Flask-based AI backend powered by models such as Google Gemini 
Pro. STIVAN examines multiple dimensions of startup ideas including innovation level, market 
demand, feasibility, financial estimations, business model clarity, and competitive positioning. The 
platform’s Node.js server manages authentication, request handling, and communication with 
MongoDB, ensuring secure and persistent data storage. The system ultimately helps users refine, 
validate, and strengthen their ideas before entering the market, making entrepreneurship more
accessible by offering instant expert-level evaluation and guidance.
• FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. User Registration &Authentication
• The system must allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
• The backend must validate credentials, enforce password rules, and maintain secure 
sessions.
2. Idea Submission Module
• Users must be able to enter their startup idea in text format.
• The idea should be stored in MongoDB and passed to the AI backend for evaluation.
3. AI-Based Idea Evaluation
• The Flask AI backend must analyze ideas using Google Gemini Pro or similar LLMs.
• The system must generate a structured evaluation report including strengths, weaknesses, 
feasibility, risks, and recommendations.
4. RAG-Based Feedback Generation
• The system must retrieve relevant data (market trends, similar startups, research insights) 
from its knowledge base.
• The AI must combine retrieved data with model reasoning to generate enhanced feedback.
5. Dashboard & Result Display
• Users must be able to view their idea evaluation report in a clear UI with sections like 
Feasibility, Market Potential, Financial Viability, etc.
• Reports must be stored and retrievable for future reference.
6. Admin or Moderator Panel (Optional)
• Admins should be able to monitor system usage, view stored ideas, and manage the 
content/knowledge base.
• NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (5–6 Points)
1. Performance & Response Time
• The system should return AI evaluations within 3–7 seconds for an optimal user experience.
• API calls must be optimized to avoid unnecessary delays.
2. Security
• User data, login credentials, and idea submissions must be securely stored.
• The system must use token-based authentication (JWT) & hashed passwords.
3. Scalability
• The architecture must support an increasing number of concurrent users.
• Database and AI backend should scale horizontally when needed.
4. Usability & UI/UX Quality
• The interface must be intuitive, responsive, and mobile-friendly.
• Complex insights should be presented in a visually clean and understandable way.
5. Reliability & Availability
• The system should have minimal downtime and must reliably store all user data and reports.
• Automatic recovery mechanisms should ensure stability of AI and database services.
6. Maintainability & Modularity
• The codebase should be modular, allowing changesin AI models, UI, or backend without 
breaking the system.
• Proper documentation and standard coding conventions must be followed.
